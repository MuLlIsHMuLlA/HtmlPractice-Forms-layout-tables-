			<p style="background-color: gray">90% of planes and ships went through the Bermuda Triangle and were never seen again. Those who survived, some of them lost the memory of it and the rest don't know what happened to them exactly. Over the years, many theoies have been offered to explain the mystery...</p>

			<p>Like rogue tidal waves being the cause, some suggestions included they were time portals, some theories were based on the appearance of strange lights in the area around the triangle
				<br>Others believe that these lights are the small craft of extraterrestrials. They believe that they are  using the Bermuda Triangle as a communication tool to communicate with the human race.</p>

		<h3>Interesting Facts</h3>

			<p>
				The most famous loss in the triangle is known as the mystery of Flight 19 and happened on 5th December 1945. A squadron of five US Navy Avenger torpedo bombers set off from their base in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to conduct a practice mission over the island of Bimini. The flight contained 14 men, all of them students apart from the commander, Lt. Charles Taylor. About an hour and a half after the mission began, radio operators received a signal from Taylor saying his compasses were not working, but he believed he was over the Florida Keys. He was advised to fly north which would bring him back to the mainland. In fact, he was over the Bahamas, and his attempts to head north and north-east merely took him further away from solid ground.

			A terrible storm that day hampered communications and it seems Taylor rejected a suggestion to pass control of the squadron to one of the other pilots. Radio contact was entirely lost and search craft were dispatched to try and find the flight to guide them back in. Of the three planes used to rescue Flight 19, one lost communications itself because of an iced over aerial, one was just unsuccessful whilst another seemed to explode shortly after take-off. Flight 19 itself has never been found, but it is assumed that they ditched into the raging sea when their fuel ran out, with the heavy planes rapidly sinking to the ocean floor. Something similar to what might have happened to Malaysia Flight MH370?
